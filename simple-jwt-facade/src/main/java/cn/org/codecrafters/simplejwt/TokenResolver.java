/**
 * {@code TokenResolver}  defines methods for creating, extracting, and
 * renewing tokens, particularly JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It provides a set of
 * methods to generate tokens with various payload configurations, extract
 * payload from tokens, and renew expired tokens.
 * <p>
 * <b>Token Creation:</b>
 * The interface provides overloaded methods for creating tokens with different
 * payload configurations, including expiration time, audience, subject, and
 * custom payload data. Clients can choose the appropriate method based on
 * their specific token requirements.
 * <p>
 * <b>Token Extraction:</b>
 * The interface includes methods to extract payload information from a given
 * token. Clients can use these methods to obtain the payload data encoded in
 * the token.
 * <p>
 * <b>Token Renewal:</b>
 * The interface also offers methods for token renewal. Clients can renew an
 * expired token by providing a new expiration time, audience, subject, and
 * optional custom payload data.
