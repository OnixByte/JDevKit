/**
 * The {@code AuthzeroTokenResolverConfig} class provides the configuration for
 * the {@link AuthzeroTokenResolver}.
 * <p>
 * This configuration is used to establish the mapping between the standard
 * {@link TokenAlgorithm} defined in the
 * {@code cn.org.codecrafters:simple-jwt-facade} and the specific algorithms
 * used by the {@code com.auth0:java-jwt} library, which is the underlying
 * library used by {@link AuthzeroTokenResolver} to handle JSON Web Tokens
 * (JWTs).
 * <p>
 * <b>Algorithm Mapping:</b>
 * The {@code AuthzeroTokenResolverConfig} allows specifying the relationships
 * between the standard {@link TokenAlgorithm} instances supported by
 * {@link AuthzeroTokenResolver} and the corresponding algorithms used by the
 * {@code com.auth0:java-jwt} library. The mapping is achieved using a Map,
 * where the keys are the standard {@link TokenAlgorithm} instances, and the
 * values represent the algorithm functions used by {@code com.auth0:java-jwt}
 * library for each corresponding key.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b>
 * The provided algorithm mapping should be consistent with the actual
 * algorithms supported and used by the {@code com.auth0:java-jwt} library. It
 * is crucial to ensure that the mapping is accurate to enable proper token
 * validation and processing within the {@link AuthzeroTokenResolver}.
