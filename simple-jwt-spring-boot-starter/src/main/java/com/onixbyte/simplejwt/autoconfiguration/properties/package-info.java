/**
 * The "cn.org.codecrafters.simplejwt.autoconfiguration.properties" package
 * contains configuration properties classes used for Simple JWT library
 * autoconfiguration. These classes define the properties that can be
 * configured in the application's properties file (e.g.,
 * application.properties) to customize the behavior and settings of the Simple
 * JWT library.
 * <p>
 * Developers can customize the JWT algorithm, issuer, and secret by setting
 * the corresponding properties in the application's properties file with the
 * prefix "code-crafters.simple-jwt". The SimpleJwtAutoConfiguration class
 * reads these properties and uses them to create the {@link
 * com.onixbyte.simplejwt.TokenResolver} bean with the desired
 * configuration.

 * @since 1.0.0
