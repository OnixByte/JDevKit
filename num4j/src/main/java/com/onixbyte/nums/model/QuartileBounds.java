/**
 * A record representing the quartile bounds of a dataset.
 * <p>
 * This class encapsulates the lower and upper bounds of a dataset, which are typically used for
 * detecting outliers in the data. The bounds are calculated based on the interquartile range (IQR)
 * of the dataset. Values below the lower bound or above the upper bound may be considered outliers.
 * <p>
 * Quartile bounds consist of:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code lowerBound} - The lower bound of the dataset, typically {@code Q1 - 1.5 * IQR}.</li>
 *   <li>{@code upperBound} - The upper bound of the dataset, typically {@code Q3 + 1.5 * IQR}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * QuartileBounds bounds = QuartileBounds.builder()
 *     .lowerBound(1.5)
 *     .upperBound(7.5)
 *     .build();
 * </pre>
 *
 * @param upperBound the upper bound of the dataset
 * @param lowerBound the lower bound of the dataset
