/**
 * The {@code PredefinedKeys} class contains constants for standard JSON Web Token (JWT) claims. These constants
 * represent the names of the standard claims that can be included in a JWT payload. Developers can use these constants
 * when working with JWTs to ensure consistent naming of the claims.
 *
 * <p>The class provides the following standard JWT claim constants:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link #ISSUER}: Represents the "iss" (Issuer) claim.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #SUBJECT}: Represents the "sub" (Subject) claim.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #AUDIENCE}: Represents the "aud" (Audience) claim.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #EXPIRATION_TIME}: Represents the "exp" (Expiration Time) claim.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #NOT_BEFORE}: Represents the "nbf" (Not Before) claim.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #ISSUED_AT}: Represents the "iat" (Issued At) claim.</li>
 *     <li>{@link #JWT_ID}: Represents the "jti" (JWT ID) claim.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The class also contains a list of all the standard claim constants, accessible via the {@link #KEYS} field. This
 * list can be useful for iterating through all the standard claims or checking for the presence of specific claims.
 *
 * <p>Note: This class is final and cannot be instantiated. It only serves as a utility class to hold the standard JWT
 * claim constants.
